# Conlangify

A tool for helping me deal with my spiralling obsession with fantasy conlangs.

## How To Use
This project doesn't have a main entrypoint at the current time. However, you can view a mockup for the GUI by running the `wxglade_out.py` file, which is currently non-functional but looks pretty. To run this file, you will need the following:
- Python 3.10
- wxPython 4.2.1

These are the version that I currently have installed which the project does work on and I suspect it would run fine on older versions as well, this is just what I have at the moment.

I plan to add some functionality to this interface in the upcoming days and I'll update the readme when there's an actual entry point for the application.

## Awaited features
- Functionality of core system and menus
- Etymology trees
- Tools for grammar inventories
- Support for custom glyphs
